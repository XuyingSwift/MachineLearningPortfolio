# Machine Learning: is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicityly programmed.
# Machine Learning: also known as learning from data, involves training algorithm to recognize patterns and making data-based decisions.

## Types of machine learning:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning:
A supervised learning algorithm takes labeled data as input and uses it to train a model that can make predictions or inferences on new, unlabeled data. 
A model is a mathematical representation of the relationship  between in the put features and target class. 
The input features refer to the quntifiable attributes that describe the data, such as weight, height, color, while the target class is the desired output, such as identifying spam or non-spam emails. (The main job of this type of algorithm is to find the relation between input features and their respective target class so that the trained model can predit the label of the unseen data in the feature.)
#### Types of supervised learning:
* Regression: is the type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable. 
* Classification: is a type of supervised learning that aims to predict a categorical label for each input.
